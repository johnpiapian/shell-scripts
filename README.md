# Shell Scripts
A collection of useful shell scripts for various tasks.


## How to use
### To run the scripts, use the following command in your terminal:

```source <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpiapian/shell-scripts/main/[script_name])```

Replace `[script_name]` with the name of the script you want to use in the repo.

### To test you can directly run:

```source <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpiapian/shell-scripts/main/test.sh)```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see "hello world" printed in your terminal.
